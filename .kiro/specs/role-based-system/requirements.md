# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive role-based access control system with AI/ML features for AgroTrack+. The system will provide distinct portals for five user roles (Customer, Farmer, Admin, Operations, Driver) with auto-generated email addresses and role-specific functionality. The implementation will focus on core features first, with AI/ML capabilities integrated where they provide immediate business value.

## Glossary

- **System**: The AgroTrack+ web application
- **User**: Any authenticated person using the platform
- **Role**: A classification defining user permissions (CUSTOMER, FARMER, ADMIN, OPERATIONS, DRIVER)
- **Portal**: A role-specific interface with customized navigation and features
- **Email Generator**: The automated system that creates unique email addresses in the format city.name.registrationNumber@role.agrotrack.com
- **Registration Number**: An auto-incrementing identifier unique per city and role combination
- **Dashboard**: The main landing page for each role showing relevant widgets and metrics
- **Access Control**: The mechanism that restricts page and API access based on user role
- **Middleware**: Server-side code that validates authentication and authorization before processing requests
- **Session**: An authenticated user's active connection containing role information
