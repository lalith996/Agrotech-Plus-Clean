# Task 21: Quality Control Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive quality control integration across the platform, providing farmers with detailed QC results and operations staff with actionable quality alerts.

## Completed Subtasks

### 21.1 Create QC Results API Endpoints ✅

**Created Files:**
- `pages/api/farmer/qc-results.ts` - Farmer-specific QC results endpoint
- `pages/api/admin/qc/alerts.ts` - Operations/Admin QC alerts endpoint

**Farmer QC Results API (`/api/farmer/qc-results`)**
- Fetches QC results for authenticated farmer
- Calculates quality score trends (current vs previous period)
- Groups results by date for trend visualization
- Returns detailed inspection data with pass/fail status
- Includes rejection reasons and notes
- Query parameters: `days` (default: 30), `limit` (default: 30)

**Response Structure:**
```typescript
{
  qualityScore: {
    current: number,
    previous: number,
    trend: 'up' | 'down' | 'stable'
  },
  trendData: Array<{
    date: string,
    score: number,
    acceptedQuantity: number,
    rejectedQuantity: number,
    totalQuantity: number
  }>,
  recentResults: Array<{
    id: string,
    productName: string,
    passRate: number,
    status: 'pass' | 'warning' | 'fail',
    rejectionReasons: string[],
    timestamp: string
  }>,
  summary: {
    totalInspections: number,
    averagePassRate: number,
    totalAccepted: number,
    totalRejected: number
  }
}
```

**QC Alerts API (`/api/admin/qc/alerts`)**
- Fetches QC results with quality issues (rejectedQuantity > 0)
- Calculates severity levels: critical (≥50%), high (≥30%), medium (≥15%), low (<15%)
- Groups alerts by farmer for farmer-level insights
- Returns top farmers with quality issues
- Query parameters: `days` (default: 7), `severity` (default: 'all')

**Response Structure:**
```typescript
{
  alerts: Array<{
    id: string,
    severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'medium' | 'low',
    productName: string,
    farmerName: string,
    rejectionRate: number,
    rejectionReasons: string[],
    timestamp: string
  }>,
  summary: {
    total: number,
    critical: number,
    high: number,
    medium: number,
    low: number,
    totalRejected: number,
    averageRejectionRate: number
  },
  topFarmersWithIssues: Array<{
    farmerId: string,
    farmerName: string,
    alertCount: number,
    averageRejectionRate: number
  }>
}
```

### 21.2 Add QC Results to Farmer Dashboard ✅

**Modified Files:**
- `pages/farmer/dashboard.tsx`

**Implementation:**
- Added new state for QC results data
- Created useEffect hook to fetch QC results on component mount
- Added "Quality Control Results" card widget to dashboard
- Displays summary statistics (total inspections, average pass rate)
- Shows recent inspection results with:
  - Product name and inspection date
  - Pass rate badge (color-coded by status)
  - Accepted/rejected quantities
  - Rejection reasons (if any)
  - Inspector notes
- Loading and empty states handled gracefully
- Positioned alongside existing quality score widget

**UI Features:**
- Color-coded status badges (green for pass, yellow for warning, red for fail)
- Detailed breakdown of each inspection
- Rejection reasons displayed as small badges
- Responsive grid layout
- Smooth loading animations

### 21.3 Add QC Alerts to Operations Dashboard ✅

**Modified Files:**
- `pages/admin/dashboard.tsx`

**Implementation:**
- Added new state for QC alerts data
- Created useEffect hook to fetch QC alerts on component mount
- Enhanced existing quality alerts widget with detailed information
- Added severity-based summary statistics (critical, high, medium, low)
- Color-coded alerts by severity level:
  - Critical: Red background (≥50% rejection)
  - High: Orange background (≥30% rejection)
  - Medium: Yellow background (≥15% rejection)
  - Low: Gray background (<15% rejection)
- Shows detailed alert information:
  - Product name and category
  - Farmer details (name, city)
  - Rejection rate percentage
  - Expected, accepted, and rejected quantities
  - Rejection reasons as badges
  - Timestamp
- Added "Farmers Requiring Attention" section showing top 3 farmers with most issues
- Available for both ADMIN and OPERATIONS roles

**UI Features:**
- Summary statistics grid showing count by severity
- Color-coded alert cards based on severity
- Detailed quantity breakdown
- Rejection reasons displayed as outline badges
- Top farmers section with alert count and average rejection rate
- Link to full QC results page
- Loading and empty states with appropriate icons

## Technical Details

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- All endpoints use NextAuth session validation
- Farmer endpoint restricted to FARMER role
- Alerts endpoint restricted to ADMIN and OPERATIONS roles
- Proper 401/403 error responses

**Database Queries:**
- Efficient Prisma queries with proper includes
- Date range filtering for performance
- Aggregations for summary statistics
- Sorted by timestamp (descending)

**Data Processing:**
- Quality score trend calculation (comparing current vs previous period)
- Severity level calculation based on rejection rates
- Grouping by date for trend visualization
- Grouping by farmer for farmer-level insights
- Pass rate calculations with proper rounding

**Error Handling:**
- Try-catch blocks in all API endpoints
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Console error logging for debugging

## Requirements Coverage

✅ **Requirement 19.1**: QC results displayed on farmer dashboard with pass/fail status
✅ **Requirement 19.2**: QC alerts displayed on operations dashboard
✅ **Requirement 19.3**: Quality score trends calculated and displayed
✅ **Requirement 19.4**: Recent QC results shown with detailed information
✅ **Requirement 19.5**: Notifications for new quality issues (via dashboard alerts)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **API Endpoint Testing:**
   - Test farmer QC results endpoint with various date ranges
   - Test alerts endpoint with different severity filters
   - Verify proper authentication/authorization
   - Test with no data (empty states)

2. **UI Testing:**
   - Verify farmer dashboard displays QC results correctly
   - Verify operations dashboard displays alerts with proper severity colors
   - Test loading states
   - Test empty states
   - Verify responsive layout on different screen sizes

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Create QC results via existing QC submission endpoint
   - Verify new results appear in farmer dashboard
