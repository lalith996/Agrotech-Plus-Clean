# Task 20: Procurement List Generation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the procurement list generation feature that automatically calculates required product quantities from upcoming orders and subscriptions, then optimally assigns them to approved farmers based on quality scores and pricing.

## Completed Subtasks

### 20.1 Create Procurement Generation API Endpoint ✅
**File:** `pages/api/admin/procurement/generate.ts`

**Key Features:**
- Calculates required quantities for next N days (configurable, default 3 days)
- Aggregates demand from:
  - Confirmed and pending orders
  - Active subscriptions (with frequency-based estimation)
- Matches requirements with approved farmers who have the products
- Calculates farmer quality scores from recent QC results
- Optimizes farmer assignments using weighted scoring:
  - 70% quality score
  - 30% price (inverse)
- Respects farmer capacity constraints
- Returns detailed procurement list with farmer assignments

**API Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/admin/procurement/generate`
- Request body: `{ days?: number }` (default: 3)
- Response includes:
  - Procurement list with items and farmer assignments
  - Date range information
  - Total items and farmers count

**Optimization Algorithm:**
1. Fetch all orders and subscriptions in date range
2. Aggregate quantities by product
3. Find approved farmers with each product
4. Calculate quality scores from QC history
5. Sort farmers by weighted score (quality + price)
6. Assign quantities respecting capacity constraints

### 20.2 Add Procurement List to Dashboards ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `pages/admin/procurement.tsx` - Complete procurement management page
- `pages/api/admin/dashboard.ts` - Dashboard API with procurement data
- `pages/admin/dashboard.tsx` - Dashboard UI with procurement widget

**Key Features:**

#### Full Procurement Page (`/admin/procurement`)
- Generate procurement lists with configurable forecast period
- Display comprehensive procurement items with:
  - Product details (name, category, total quantity, unit)
  - Assigned farmers with:
    - Farm name and farmer name
    - Quality score badges (color-coded)
    - Contact phone numbers (clickable)
    - Price per unit
    - Capacity information
    - Assigned quantity
- Manual adjustment capability:
  - Edit assigned quantities per farmer
  - Save/cancel changes
  - Respects farmer capacity limits
- Summary metrics:
  - Date range
  - Total products
  - Total farmers
  - Forecast days
- Responsive design with proper loading and error states

#### Dashboard Integration
- Procurement list widget on both Admin and Operations dashboards
- Shows top 5 procurement items
- Displays:
  - Product name
  - Total quantity and unit
  - Number of assigned farmers
  - Status badge
- Quick link to full procurement page

### Quality Score Calculation
- Based on last 10 QC results per farmer
- Formula: `(Total Accepted / Total Expected) * 100`
- Default score: 85% for farmers without QC history

### Farmer Assignment Optimization
- Weighted scoring: `(Quality * 0.7) - (Price * 0.3)`
- Sorts farmers by score (descending)
- Assigns quantities up to capacity
- Continues to next farmer if more quantity needed

### Subscription Estimation
- Weekly frequency: 1 delivery per 7 days
- Biweekly frequency: 1 delivery per 14 days
- Calculates deliveries in forecast period
- Multiplies by subscription item quantity

## Access Control
- Available to: ADMIN and OPERATIONS roles
- Protected by middleware and API route checks
- Uses RoleBasedLayout component

## UI/UX Features
- Clean, modern design with Tailwind CSS
- Color-coded quality score badges:
  - Green: ≥90%
  - Yellow: 75-89%
  - Red: <75%
- Clickable phone numbers for easy contact
- Inline editing with save/cancel actions
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive grid layouts
- Hover effects and transitions

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- Persist procurement lists to database
- Track procurement status (pending, confirmed, completed)
- Send notifications to farmers
- Historical procurement analytics
- Automated procurement scheduling
- Integration with inventory management
- Farmer availability calendar

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various forecast periods (1-14 days)
2. Verify quantity calculations with different order scenarios
3. Test farmer assignment with varying quality scores
4. Verify manual adjustment functionality
5. Test with no orders/subscriptions (edge case)
6. Test with products having no approved farmers
7. Verify access control for different roles

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 20.1: Calculate required quantities for next 3 days from orders and subscriptions
- ✅ 20.2: Match requirements with farmer availability
- ✅ 20.3: Optimize for cost and quality based on farmer performance
- ✅ 20.4: Return procurement list with farmer assignments
- ✅ 20.5: Display procurement list on admin/operations dashboard with manual adjustment capability and farmer contact information

## Conclusion
The procurement list generation feature is fully implemented and provides a comprehensive solution for managing daily procurement needs. The system intelligently assigns products to farmers based on quality and cost optimization, while providing operations staff with the tools to manually adjust assignments as needed.
